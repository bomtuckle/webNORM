# webNORM: An Open-Source Web Application for Normative Mineralogy Calculations

## Introduction

webNORM is a user-friendly [web application](https://webnorm.streamlit.app/) and Python-based implementation of the normative mineralogy algorithm described by Verma et al. (2003). This tool is created to be an accessible solution for calculating normative mineralogy for the geoscience community.

The application uses major, minor, and trace element oxides as input and returns up to 31 normative minerals, with two methods for estimating the Fe2O3:FeO ratio. You can access webNORM either as a standalone web application or use the underlying normative algorithm through the pyrolite Python package for end-to-end geochemical data analysis.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Web Application:** Offers a convenient interface for users without programming experience.
- **Open-Source:** Encourage contributions and adaptations by the community for specific needs and improvements.

## Installation and Usage

The webNORM web application does not require any installation and can be accessed [here](https://webnorm.streamlit.app/).

To access the normative algorithm used by webNORM please head to the  [pyrolite github page](https://github.com/morganjwilliams/pyrolite) and follow the installation instructions
